# Authentication Service Development Tasks

This document outlines the step-by-step process to build the authentication service for Streamflix, from MVP to enterprise-scale.

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Authentication (MVP)

### Environment and Project Setup

- [ ] Install essential dependencies (bcrypt, passport, jwt, @nestjs/config)
  ```bash
  npm install --save @nestjs/passport passport passport-local @nestjs/jwt passport-jwt bcrypt @nestjs/config class-validator class-transformer pg @nestjs/typeorm typeorm
  npm install --save-dev @types/passport-local @types/passport-jwt @types/bcrypt
  ```
- [ ] Configure environment variables using dotenv (.env.development, .env.test, .env.production)
- [ ] Set up a database module with TypeORM for PostgreSQL and configure connection pooling (max 20)
- [ ] Create a basic health check endpoint at `/health` for Kubernetes probes

### User Entity and Repository

- [ ] Create User entity with basic fields (id, email, password, role, createdAt, updatedAt)
- [ ] Implement password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12) in a pre-save hook
- [ ] Create user repository with CRUD operations and email lookup
- [ ] Add database migrations for the user table

### Basic Authentication Logic

- [ ] Create AuthModule, AuthService, and AuthController
- [ ] Implement email/password signup endpoint with input validation
- [ ] Implement login endpoint with passport-local strategy
- [ ] Create JWT access token generation with 1-hour expiration

- [ ] Create protected route `/auth/me` to return current user profile

### Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests for AuthService

- [ ] Add IP-based suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Create audit logging for authentication events
- [ ] Add device tracking and management
- [ ] Implement 2FA with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

## Phase 4: Observability and Enterprise Features

### Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up Winston for structured JSON logging
- [ ] Configure log levels and contextual logging
- [ ] Add request/response logging middleware
- [ ] Implement log shipping to ELK
- [ ] Create custom log transports

### Metrics and Instrumentation

- [ ] Install and configure prom-client
- [ ] Expose metrics endpoint at `/metrics`
- [ ] Create custom JWT and authentication metrics
- [ ] Add histogram for API latency
- [ ] Create dashboard templates (Grafana)

### Distributed Tracing

- [ ] Install OpenTelemetry packages
- [ ] Configure auto-instrumentation for NestJS
- [ ] Add W3C Trace Context headers
- [ ] Create custom span attributes for auth events
- [ ] Set up trace exporting to observability backend

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexing
- [ ] Add connection pooling configurations
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown hooks
- [ ] Load test service and tune parameters

## Phase 5: Infrastructure and Deployment

### Docker and Kubernetes

- [ ] Create Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
- [ ] Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Configure liveness and readiness probes
- [ ] Set up horizontal pod autoscaling
- [ ] Create helm chart for the service

### Secret Management

- [ ] Configure HashiCorp Vault integration
- [ ] Set up secure secret injection
- [ ] Rotate JWT signing keys
- [ ] Implement encrypted environment variables
- [ ] Create key management procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI
