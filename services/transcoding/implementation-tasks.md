## Requirements for AI Agent Success

To achieve the best results when implementing these tasks, ensure your AI agent follows these principles:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Follow the phases in order, completing each task fully before moving to the next.

2. **Context Management**:

   - Focus on one task at a time to avoid context window limitations
   - Reference specific files by absolute path when editing
   - Use clear code documentation to help maintain context across sessions

3. **Code Quality Standards**:

   - Follow .NET coding conventions
   - Use dependency injection
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Write unit tests for critical components
   - Use async/await patterns for I/O operations

4. **Documentation Requirements**:

   - Document public APIs and interfaces
   - Add XML comments to classes and methods
   - Create README files explaining component functionality
   - Document configuration options

5. **Testing Approach**:

   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Create integration tests for external dependencies
   - Add health checks for all components
   - Implement test coverage reporting

6. **Architectural Patterns**:
   - Follow clean architecture principles
   - Use repository pattern for data access
   - Implement mediator pattern for message handling
   - Use factory pattern for creating transcoding profiles
   - Apply SOLID principles

By following this framework, your AI agent can build a complete, enterprise-grade Transcoding Service while working within context window limitations.
